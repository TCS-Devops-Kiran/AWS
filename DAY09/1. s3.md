# Amazon S3 – Full Tutorial with Practical Setup

This document provides a detailed explanation of Amazon S3 service, including bucket creation, object upload, storage classes, file limits, versioning, lifecycle policies, and Glacier-based archival workflows. Designed for classroom and real-world teaching.

## What is Amazon S3?

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

You can store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

---

## Key Concepts

* **Buckets**: Containers for storing objects
* **Objects**: Files stored in S3 (with metadata)
* **Keys**: Unique identifier for each object within a bucket
* **Regions**: Buckets are region-scoped

---

## Step 1: S3 Bucket Creation

1. Go to AWS Management Console → S3 → Create bucket
2. Enter a globally unique **Bucket name** (e.g., `my-app-bucket`)
3. Select **AWS Region** (choose where to store data)
4. **Object Ownership**: Recommended: ACLs disabled (Bucket owner enforced)
5. **Block Public Access**: Enable all for private data
6. Enable **Versioning** (optional, can be enabled later)
7. Add **Tags** (optional)
8. Default **Encryption** (Enable SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS if required)
9. Click **Create bucket**

> Bucket name must be globally unique and cannot be changed once created.

## Step 2: Upload Objects

1. Open the bucket
2. Click **Upload** → Add Files (choose your local file)
3. Click **Upload**

---

## S3 Limits

* Max object size (per upload): **5 TB**
* Max object size (via console upload): **160 GB**
* Multipart upload recommended for files larger than **100 MB**
* Default bucket quota: **100 buckets per AWS account**

### How to Increase Bucket Quota

* Go to **Service Quotas → Amazon S3**
* Select "Buckets per account"
* Click "Request Quota Increase"

## S3 Storage Classes

| Class                       | Designed for                               | AZs | Min Duration | Retrieval Cost        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Standard                    | Frequently accessed data                   | ≥3  | None         | None                  |
| Intelligent-Tiering         | Data with unpredictable access patterns    | ≥3  | None         | Per-object monitoring |
| Standard-IA                 | Infrequent access, durable                 | ≥3  | 30 days      | Per-GB                |
| One Zone-IA                 | Infrequent, non-critical data (single AZ)  | 1   | 30 days      | Per-GB                |
| Glacier Instant Retrieval   | Archive with instant access                | ≥3  | 90 days      | Per-GB                |
| Glacier Flexible Retrieval  | Archive, minutes to hours retrieval        | ≥3  | 90 days      | Per-GB                |
| Glacier Deep Archive        | Long-term cold storage, retrieval in hours | ≥3  | 180 days     | Per-GB                |
| Reduced Redundancy (Legacy) | Non-critical, less durable                 | ≥3  | None         | Not recommended       |

## Step 3: Upload File with Glacier Storage Class

1. Go to your bucket → Upload → Add Files
2. Under **Properties**, choose **Storage Class**: `Glacier Flexible Retrieval` or `Glacier Deep Archive`
3. Complete the upload

### Restore from Glacier:

1. Select the object
2. Click **Actions → Initiate Restore**
3. Select retrieval option (e.g., Standard/Expedited)
4. Specify duration (e.g., 7 days)
5. After restoration completes, object is temporarily accessible

---

## S3 Versioning

* Tracks all versions of an object stored in a bucket
* Allows recovery from accidental deletes or overwrites

### Enable Versioning

1. Go to the bucket → Properties
2. Click **Edit** under Versioning
3. Choose **Enable**, click **Save changes**

### Behavior After Enabling Versioning

* Uploading the same object name creates **new versions**
* Deleting a versioned object adds a **Delete Marker**
* Previous versions still exist and can be restored

### Restore Versioned Object

1. Open bucket → Show versions
2. Select an older version → Click **Download** or **Make Current**

---

## Lifecycle Rules in S3

Lifecycle policies automate object transitions and expiration to save cost.

### Create Lifecycle Policy

1. Go to bucket → **Management** tab → **Lifecycle rules** → Create rule
2. Enter Rule name
3. Choose scope (apply to all objects or with prefix/tags)
4. Choose actions:

   * Transition to another storage class (e.g., to Glacier after 30 days)
   * Expire current versions after X days
   * Delete expired delete markers
5. Review and save

### Example Rule

* Move objects to Standard-IA after 30 days
* Move to Glacier after 60 days
* Delete after 365 days
